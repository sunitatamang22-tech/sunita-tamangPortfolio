# Sunita Tamang – Portfolio
I am a Master’s student in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics at the University of the Sunshine Coast, Australia. My current research focuses on the impact of malware attacks on small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), exploring how cyber threats affect productivity and resilience. Alongside my studies, I bring over 3 years of experience in software quality assurance and recently completed a cybersecurity internship at Ausbiz Consulting, where I gained practical skills in penetration testing, payload exploitation, and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) implementation. I am passionate about Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) and I use this portfolio to showcase my projects, technical skills, and continuous learning journey in the field of cybersecurity.
